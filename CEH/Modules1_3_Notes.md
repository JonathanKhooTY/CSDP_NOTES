#### Electronic warfare: 
* Electronic warfare uses radio electronic and cryptographic techniques to degrade communication. Radio electronic techniques attack the physical means of sending information, whereas cryptographic techniques use bits and bytes to disrupt the means of sending information.

#### Host-Based Indicators: 
Host-based indicators are found by performing an analysis of the infected system within the organizational network. Examples of host-based indicators include filenames, file hashes, registry keys, DLLs, and mutex

#### Behavioral Indicators: 
Behavioral IoCs are used to identify specific behavior related to malicious activities such as code injection into the memory or running an application's scripts. Well-defined behaviors enable broad protection to block all current and future malicious activities
